    "2020 has been one crazy year! Quarantined for what was meant to be my final months of high school as a senior, I have had the lovely chance to spend a lot of time with my family before I head off for college. As a function of this status quo, I have had a series of intense table tennis matches with my dad. Almost all, ending with a bitter loss for myself. While deep down I recognize the massive skill discrepancy, I like to cover my losses with the \"My racket isn't as good as yours\" excuse. One day, after reaching my 37th loss, a thought crossed my mind: what if I used my data science skills to discover the greatest table tennis paddle. From that moment on, this project was born."

Since certain datapoints had an \"N\" or a \"B\" at the end of the name (delineating B for best seller and N for new item), I created a function using a lambda and replace function to remove these instances. Finally, I dealt with missing values in the \"Speed\", \"Spin\" and \"Control\" columns by replacing them with the mean of each column. While there are many other ways to impute missing values, I choose to use the mean approach based on the data distributions.

    "- Rubbers with higher control aren't necessarily sold at higher prices. This is likely because a feature I identified later in the analysis in the negative relationship between control and speed. Players tend to favor offensive play vs defensive, and therefore there is a higher demand for rackets with more speed and correspondingly less control."

As speed increased, the control of the blade drastically decreased. This sparked my interest in finding the optimal combination between speed and control which is what I'll explore later in the notebook. The other interesting relationship that I noticed was betweeen blade speed and blade weight. As the speed increased the weight of the blade also increased. Based on this I came to the conclusion that heavier blades, favoring speed, were typically tailored towards offensive style of play while the lighter blades, favoring control, were typically tailored for a defensive style of play. Based on this, I wondered whether certain brands of blades were better for offensive players or defensive players."
